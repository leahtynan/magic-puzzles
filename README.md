# Magic Puzzles

These digital puzzles play music as pieces are placed. When the puzzle is complete, the entire song plays continuously and the picture animates. 

Currently, I have original content for two puzzles (at time of writing, just one is in the interactive), and when complete this software will feature 5-10 puzzles. My musician friends are generously offering their time and creativity to compose the music.

I'm creating original hand-drawn art for the puzzles and playing my acoustic piano to generate the audio featured in the software.
